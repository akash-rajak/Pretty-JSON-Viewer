### ðŸ“ŒREQUIREMENTS :
- node.js
- Visual Studio Code

****

### ðŸ“ŒHow this React App works :
- First user need to download the app and open the folder `pretty-json-viewer` in the Visual Studio Code.
- Inorder to run the app, follow below steps:
	- This command will change the directory to the app directory.
	```
	cd pretty-react-app
	```
	- This will start compiling the app, and after compiling it will provide the option of link where we can view the app, and even opens the app in default browser.
	```
	npm start
	```
- In the brower, user will see the option to select the JSON file using `Choose File` button.
- When user selects the JSON file, the file name will be visible next to the button and `Copy JSON` button will gets enabled, and below that `JSON Content` will be visible.
- IMP : Also if user clicks on `Choose File` button, and end up selecting no JSON file, then the `Copy JSON` button and `JSON Content Area` will be disabled from the webpage, as no file is selected.

<!--  Readme given the React App by default---------------------------------------------
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
